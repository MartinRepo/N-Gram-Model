Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.
We shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc.
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.
That is why there is an urgent need for reform, and no one takes issue with this in debate.
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.
Thank you very much.
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.
That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group.
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the Commission, with only one vote against and two abstentions.
The guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether Article 1 of the regulation is actually being implemented.
This is what I expect the outcome of the Community development programmes to be, and I do not expect you to give way on this again.
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.
Nevertheless, certain critics are of the opinion that the Commission' s proposals go too far.
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.
In other words, this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.
I too forgot my card, and I would have voted against.
However, we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission.
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.
Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.
I am not criticising this; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.
This latter point is of particular importance.
It is not a lot to ask.
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.
These are already in existence in certain Member States and they have proved successful.
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.
My third point has also been mentioned already.
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much.
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions.
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.
While I am on the subject, I would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the EU and call on the Commission to give due attention to this.
We call upon those Member States that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and, of course, we expect the Commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period 2000 to 2006 in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report, and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner.
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.
Agenda
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.
We need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cutting-down on transport, heavy rail traffic, road pricing and railway privatisation, with a view to improving functionality.
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.
The decentralisation proposed by the Commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity, which has, in fact, now been firmly established in the Treaty.
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.
In short, the issue is an important one.
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines.
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.
I believe it is a good thing that the Commission is holding firm here.
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.
As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.
Are there any comments?
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.
That is, if he so wishes, of course.
This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.
Secondly, the national courts will be empowered to implement Articles 81 (1), 82 and 86 in accordance with the current administration of justice.
