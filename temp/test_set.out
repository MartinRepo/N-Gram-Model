This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.
How long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for, resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions?
One searches the document in vain for the central principle, which calls upon the Member States to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors, business and social organisations, NGOs, unions, employers' associations, women' s organisations, citizens' initiatives and employment initiatives.
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.
Parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past.
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.
But the system has hardly changed at all.
The reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support.
That was the decision.
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects.
That said, the process is still very much in its infancy.
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma.
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.
The lion' s share of the transfer payments has been, and still is, used for investment in rationalisation and modernisation, with the intention of improving labour productivity.
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
However, this at least places the Commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable European objectives to be achieved.
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
Incidentally, I would just like to address a comment to the government of my country, where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal Community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the FFH guideline.
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out.
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.
This was very soon forgotten, however, when the Commission developed the new instrument for the purpose, the guidelines, and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency, concentration, and simplification of administration in the implementation of the European structural funds more binding.
There was a vote on this matter.
This brings me to my final point.
Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion.
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.
Let that be clearly noted and understood.
However, it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the Commission are published.
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.
This leads to increased implementation of the European competition rules at national and regional level, thereby making it possible for the European competition culture to be placed on a broader basis.
The report demonstrates that - measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita - the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue.
That did not happen.
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.
I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.
We must give them this opportunity.
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own.
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.
This has particularly affected the four cohesion countries - in the positive sense of course - as it has the five former East German Länder.
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.
A very important point to my mind.
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.
In the Conference of Presidents, we had an in-depth discussion.
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.
I should now like to comment on the issue itself.
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.
